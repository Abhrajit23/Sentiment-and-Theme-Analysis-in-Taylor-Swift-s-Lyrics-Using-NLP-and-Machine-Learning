## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the **evolution of time-related themes** (e.g., *day*, *night*, *midnight*) in Taylor Swift’s lyrics and how these correlate with the **emotional sentiment** expressed in her songs. By applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning models**, the analysis uncovers trends in both language and emotion across her discography.

The goal is to deliver a **data-driven report** supported by visualizations and sentiment metrics, offering meaningful insight into her lyrical and artistic development.

## ⚠️ Assumptions, Risks & Obstacles

### 🔍 Assumptions

* Dataset contains accurate, complete lyrics across albums
* Python libraries and pre-trained models are sufficient
* Sentiment analysis yields meaningful interpretations despite subjectivity

---

### ⚠️ Risks

* Pre-trained models may misclassify poetic/metaphorical content
* Keyword-based detection may miss subtle time references
* Sentiment scores may vary due to contextual ambiguity

---

### 🚧 Obstacles

* Cleaning lyrics while retaining meaning is challenging
* Tuning models and creating strong visuals may take longer than expected
* Limited time for hyperparameter optimization
